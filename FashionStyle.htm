                        Going for separates instead of a full suit gives you more versatility within your outfit.<br />
                        A jumper, instead of a shirt, is a clever twist on a classic look.

                        When it's warm, a shirt can double as a jacket. Stick to plain everything – white tee,<br />
                        dark jeans, neutral shirt – to keep your silhouette the focus.

                        The easiest summer outfits are ones built with wardrobe essentials, like khaki shorts and a navy tee. <br />
                        Rounding out your look with a harrington jacket adds a smart, stylish element.

                        Got a social occassion coming up that you don't know how to dress for? Just throw on a pair of stone chinos,<br />
                        a dazzlingly white polo, and brown boat shoes.

                        It's easier than you think to dress smartly. To cheat it, dress in dark tones like navy and black, <br />
                        and throw in a roll-neck knit and suede boots for a refined finish.

                        Navy and white is a stylish pairing and easier to wear on brighter days than a classic black and white monochrome look.<br />
                        Plus it’s a super versatile combination, so wear it to the office or out on the weekend.

                        The denim shirt may be a casual must-have with workwear roots, but it works just as well off-duty too. In warmer weather, <br />
                        try a short-sleeved version so you can keep this versatile favourite on rotation all year round.
